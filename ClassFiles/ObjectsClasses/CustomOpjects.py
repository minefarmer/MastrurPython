'''             Objects - Python
    Custom Objects: Classes
1. Everything in python is an object - strings, integers, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, functions, etc.
2. I can create my own custom objects - if an existing type is not adequate for your needs, build your own using classes.
3. Functions associated with instances of Objects are known as methods.
    Methods I have seen and used so far.
        upper(), lower(), split(), find(), append(), pop(), remove(), insert(), sort(), items(), keys(), values(), and many more.
4. Look differient from functions in how they were called.
    Usually took the form of my_list.append() or my_list.sort(), whereas the sorted() function took the form of sorteg(my_list).


>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3]
>>> my_string = "richard"
>>> my_dictionary = {'a':'apple','b':'banana'}
>>> dir(my_list)

        NOTES ON CLASSES, OBJECTS AND OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm.

    1. Uses inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and more.
    2. Used extensively in software developement.
    3. Clean, efficient way of packaging, reusing and maintaining code.
    4. Can be a course in itself, we will cover custom objects, creation of classes and methods, which are the basis of all OOP.
    5. Will demo inheritance and subclasses since it's important to see how it's done, but, not in detail, not necessary for this course either.
